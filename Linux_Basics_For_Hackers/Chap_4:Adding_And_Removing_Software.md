# Adding And Removing Software
1. First search for the existence of the package with command ``apt-cache search``.<br>
  Then to install use command `apt-get install [package name]`.
2. To remove the package use command `apt-get remove [package name]`.This command doesn't remove the configuration files.<br>To remove the configuration files use command `apr-get purge snort`.
3. To update your repository use command `apt-get update`.
4. To upgrade your software packages use command `apt-get upgrade`.
5. For this I will use the perl script present in github which is used for DOS attack more specifically slowloris attack<br>
Link to the repo : https://github.com/GHubgenius/slowloris.pl <br> 
Use command : `git clone https://github.com/GHubgenius/slowloris.pl` to clone the repository from github and perform DOS :)
